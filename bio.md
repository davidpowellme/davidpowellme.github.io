![Me wearing a cool hat](/images/hat-landscape.jpg "Me wearing a cool hat")


I’m a junior UI/UX designer switching careers from bartending. My work in bars and restaurants over the last decade taught me the most important skill for user-centered design: empathy. Before I worked full-time as a bartender and bar manager, though, I was developing more skills as a designer and writer.

As a freelance web designer from 2013 to 2017, I designed, redesigned, and maintained websites for various small business clients in both B2B and B2C industries.

As a freelance content writer and social media manager from 2013 to 2017, I wrote articles, blogs, newsletters, and social media posts for various clients utilizing their voice and brand.

In 2016, I completed The Iron Yard User Interface Design bootcamp. During this 12-week course, I gained skills in user research, user testing, wireframing, creating mockups, and responsive web design.

I’m looking for work. I’m refreshing and enhancing my skills daily, and I’m building a new portfolio. If you’re seeking someone who is passionate about designing experiences that solve problems for all users, I’d love to join your team.
