One of the most practical things The Iron Yard ATX does for students is putting them on a project with a client while they're still in the course. Like most work education, doing projects and talking about principles makes you _think_ you can do a job, but you don't know until you're actually working with the client.

Our UI Design class (which is only 6 people) split into 3 groups of 2 and worked as partners to create a web app for a local non-profit. Our client was RED Arena, a horse-riding therapy center for people with mental and physical disabilities. Currently, the organization has roughly a dozen employees, 20-30 volunteers who help them, and a few hundred clients who ride.

The project was a web app to help RED Arena more effectively organize appointments with riders. TIY's own Justin Herrick, a backend instructor, would be developing the app based off one of our design team's style guides and mockup.

##The Problem
The non-profit is currently using a Google spreadsheet that they print out each day as their schedule. A few of the columns and row contain standby information, like who's working what position with what rider and what time.

Other rows and columns have been tacked onto the spreadsheet as afterthoughts.

The shortcomings of this system are obvious, just a few include:
- When an appointment is canceled, the administrator has to send a group text from their phone (or text each staff member, volunteer, and client individually)
- When the schedule is updated, the only way for staff and clients to know is meticulously check a massive Google Spreadsheet or wait for a new copy of the schedule to be printed.

Since keeping track of the schedule and contacting people with changes isn't a streamlined process, sometimes cancellations or changes fall through the cracks, and clients or staff show up for appointments only to find out they wasted a trip.

##Design Challenges
My partner of this project was Scott Anderson, another designer in the UI track at The Iron Yard ATX. Our challenge seemed pretty straightforward, but besides time constraints, we had more challenges to navigate:
- The staff and volunteers at RED Arena range in age and comfortability A LOT
- Scott and I have different tastes and styles in design
- Justin is a developer, not a designer and would need precise mockups/style guides
- The majority of users would be viewing the app from their mobile device, but the schedule needed to be easy to print out

Add into the mix the fact we'd only been UI designers for about 8 weeks, and this was a huge task.

##Wireframes and Styling
Scott and I created a Trello board and shared Github repo. We communicated primarily in person after class or over Slack and started sketching and wireframing the first day.

We touched base regularly, and if we hadn't I don't think the project would ever have been finished. Designing a congruent site with two different peoples ideas isn't easy.

After we worked to make the wireframes fit together, we divided and conquered again in style tile creation. At this point, I was extremely grateful for another designer, because I can get stuck in the same styles, same ideas, and even same typefaces. Working with someone different challenged the norm and gave the project fresh life.

Scott and I worked out 2 style tiles each, and when we met to discuss them, we couldn't help but laugh. While they were different in styling (color palette, typeface) the directions we had taken them were exactly the same. Each of us had created one more modern, professional tile and one playful, kid-friendly tile.

We decided we would each take a direction and create one final representation of the styles of our app.

I went back to the Internet and found the Invisible Children website. I ripped their styles down almost entirely, created a copycat tile, and then started tweaking different elements. When we came back together, Scott and our instructor Abby and I found a more usable typeface, but in the end, that tile is the one we used.

##Mocking Up
Scott and I once more divided and conquered. He created a living style guide which Justin could easily reference and from which he could rip HTML and CSS for his development.

I feel like I created the site 4 different times in Illustrator, because every time we asked for feedback, I would realilze something I missed or could do better. In the end, I mocked up 3-5 pages with different modals/form elements and did every page at 3 different breakpoints. Scott and I even came to campus all day Sunday to finish the project.

I'm proud of the work we did, but I don't feel like it's finished--I never do at TIY. I think that's good though. I love what I do, and I understand why the saying is "art is never finished, only abandoned". Unfortunately, I have 2 more projects before this is finished, and I might have to abandon it for now.

**Things I learned on this project**
- Get feedback early and often
- Send "users" through your app early and often
- Communicate honestly with your team
- Ask you client, dev, and team as many questions as you can early on

It's weird, but I think most of the lessons I've learned from the projects at The Iron Yard aren't about floating elements or using the pen tool or merging on Github or anything.

It's mostly soft skills--Life skills--that make or break your design and development process.

Just over 2 weeks to go!
